// PostingReader is implemented by adapters that can read a single posting page
// into a complete NormalizedJob. Optional: an adapter without it cannot serve
// manual add, and its hosts degrade to the fill-in path.
//
// Implementors must honour six rules:
//
//  1. MatchesPostingURL does no I/O and never panics on malformed input — it is
//     called for every registered adapter on every add, in registry order, and
//     the first claim wins.
//  2. It returns false for search URLs on its own host. A Djinni preset-search
//     URL is a Djinni URL that is not a posting, and the caller reports
//     not_a_posting precisely because the host was claimed but the shape was
//     rejected.
//  3. ReadPosting returns partial results rather than erroring when the page
//     loads but some fields are absent — that partial result is what feeds the
//     fill-in draft. It errors only when the page could not be read at all.
//  4. It honours the context deadline and returns context.DeadlineExceeded
//     wrapped no more deeply than errors.Is can see.
//  5. It sets SourceKey to its own Key() and resolves URL to an absolute,
//     canonical form.
//  6. It uses the same retrieval path as the adapter's other methods, so pacing
//     and ladder escalation apply unchanged (041 FR-003c).
